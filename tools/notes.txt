Todo
    + Add spectre-console  for formatted outputs, make this i to format-table
        + Format-Spectre - Make this the default for get-emoji, get-emoji in text, get-ciset, getcisetfusion and perhaps get-autoversion
    + IO overhead operations thats not required 
        + reading/writing template file to disk, use variable instead write template file current has 5 IO operations
        + Replace with variables or just use the class variables holding the commit string
    + Add confirm prompt and the ability to bypass -bypass for set-commit
    + Add logtastic as console loger was module is released
    + Add ShellDock for commits to run in runspace - reason, serves not purpose
